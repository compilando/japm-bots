# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Bot System team takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to `security@example.com` with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

### What to Include

Please include as much information as possible:

- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., injection, authentication bypass, etc.)
- **Component**: Which service or component is affected
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve
- **Environment**: Version, configuration details
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity (see below)

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Response Time | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Critical | 24-48 hours | Remote code execution, authentication bypass |
| High | 3-7 days | Privilege escalation, data exposure |
| Medium | 1-2 weeks | Information disclosure, DoS |
| Low | 2-4 weeks | Minor security improvements |

## Security Measures

### Current Protections

- **Input Validation**: All API endpoints validate input
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin controls
- **Helmet.js**: Security headers implementation
- **Container Security**: Non-root users in containers
- **Network Isolation**: Services communicate internally

### Development Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits
- **Code Review**: All changes require review
- **Static Analysis**: Security-focused linting
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability checks

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Sensitive configuration should use environment variables:

```bash
# Use strong passwords
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-strong-password

# Use secure URLs
WEBHOOK_URL=https://secure-endpoint.com

# Enable security features
HELMET_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED=true
```

### Docker Security

Default security configurations:

```dockerfile
# Run as non-root user
USER node

# Read-only filesystem where possible
RUN mkdir -p /app && chown node:node /app
WORKDIR /app

# Minimal attack surface
FROM node:18-alpine
```

### Network Security

- Services communicate via internal Docker network
- External access only through designated ports
- TLS encryption for external communications

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Report Received**: Security team acknowledges receipt
2. **Initial Triage**: Assess severity and impact
3. **Investigation**: Reproduce and analyze the issue
4. **Fix Development**: Create and test security patch
5. **Coordinated Disclosure**: 
   - Notify affected users
   - Release security update
   - Publish security advisory

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
- **Secure Configuration**: Follow security guidelines
- **Monitor Logs**: Watch for suspicious activity
- **Network Security**: Use firewalls and VPNs
- **Access Control**: Limit who can access the system

### For Developers

- **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP guidelines
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
- **Input Validation**: Validate all external input
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information
- **Logging**: Log security events appropriately

## Common Security Scenarios

### Bot Execution Security

- Bots run in isolated containers
- No direct file system access
- Limited network connectivity
- Resource limits applied

### Webhook Security

- Webhook URLs validated
- TLS encryption enforced
- Retry limits prevent abuse
- Request signing (recommended)

### Queue Security

- Redis authentication required
- Internal network communication
- Job data encryption (optional)
- Access logging enabled

## Security Tools

### Recommended Tools

- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Clair
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit, Snyk
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint security rules
- **Runtime Security**: Falco, Sysdig

### Monitoring

- Monitor for unusual patterns:
  - High error rates
  - Unexpected endpoints
  - Large payloads
  - Frequent retries

## Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Breach

1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assess**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Contain**: Prevent further damage
4. **Report**: Notify security team
5. **Recover**: Restore normal operations
6. **Learn**: Conduct post-incident review

### Contact Information

- **Security Team**: security@example.com
- **Emergency**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX (24/7)
- **GPG Key**: Available on request
